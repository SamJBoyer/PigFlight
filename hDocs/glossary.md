hDocs: shorthand for helmsman documents. 

itags: itag stands for issue-tags. issue-tags refer to the tag in the repository git issues page. Helmsman makes heavy use of git issues as a cheap and accessible way to create tickets related to the project. As a result, there are many different tags used to designate which issues mean which thing. For example, issues may be marked as ideas, features, bugs, etc. itag may have shared definitions between projects and repo-unique definitions. The itag section is the ground truth for what each tag means, which tags are used, and when to use each tag.

iticket: an instance of a git issue that has an itag

iPool: a document that contains a variably-structured list of thoughts, ideas, questions, and wants. Typically will live inside a lucidchart. Look at hDocs/remotes#lucidchart section to check for a remote iPool document.

critical question: a 2 sentence summary of the fundamental uncertainty that balances a critical desire
